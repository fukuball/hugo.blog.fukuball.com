最近聽到 Swim Deep 的 She Changes the Weather 覺得蠻讚的，忍不住想推薦給大家聽聽看～

歌曲一開始是用吉他分散和弦做鋪陳，輔以簡易的鍵盤和弦墊底，慢慢地低語。中間轉折橋段鍵盤變得緊湊了起來，然後貝斯及合成器也慢慢地加了進來，且背景中人聲啁哳談話的聲音，讓這個橋段有了畫龍點睛的效果，最後爵士鼓聲加了進來，讓整首歌振奮了起來。

聽這首歌有種開車兜風的感覺，一邊聽著車子就跟著越開越快了，但是是以一種舒服愉快的速度航行，讓人感到舒適愜意！

雖然這首歌感覺是蠻適合開車或旅行聽，但實際上這首歌是一首情歌，特別喜歡他這句歌詞：

<blockquote>
Cause what you say will make my day<br>
Rid of consequence<br>
It's so weird, but it's so clear.<br>
</blockquote>

是一種掉入愛情的感覺，描寫得蠻貼切的，哈哈。歌曲從一開始的低語到後來的輕快，是否也是代表著從沈思自己的情感到積極面對，然後勇敢地在這愛意裡兜風呢？

<blockquote>
She takes my time,<br>
She grows the flowers in my mind,<br>
She makes it shine in my mould<br>
She makes me trip<br>
The words just fall out of my lips<br>
And I forgot how to lie<br>
A song reminds me<br>
Sidetrack my life<br>
It's easy as 369, 369.<br>
<br>
Seen it all but I've seen nothing yet<br>
Cause I forget<br>
Do I know or do I think I know?<br>
It's so weird, it's so clear.<br>
<br>
She takes my time and I don't mind<br>
She makes me feel like<br>
Like I can see for miles.<br>
She changes the weather in my world<br>
Seems like it's never getting cold.<br>
<br>
It's OK, it's not obvious<br>
Cause what you say will make my day<br>
Rid of consequence<br>
It's so weird, but it's so clear.<br>
<br>
She takes my time and I don't mind<br>
She makes me feel like<br>
Like I can see for miles.<br>
She changes the weather in my world<br>
Seems like we're never getting old.<br>
<br>
She takes my time and I don't mind<br>
She makes me feel like<br>
Like I can see for miles.<br>
She changes the weather in my world<br>
Seems like it's never getting cold.<br>
