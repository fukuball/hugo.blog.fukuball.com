Under The Stars

Under The Stars is a tale of a young boy's need for a constant male figure in his life. With his parents having recently split, his only option is his late grandad who he seeks solace from, under the stars. It aims to touch the audience, make them think about loved and lost ones, recollect memories, and consider the support a child may need in such circumstances.

Under The Stars Final Ver.

This was an extremely special experience. I’ve been busy with so many projects lately but this song caught me by surprise. I originally had no idea what would be Julia’s first single. Even when I got the demo I was still kinda iffy about it. Nevertheless, the moment I pulled up the drum machine (Maschine, in this case) and threw on some drum kit samples, I started to realize this song did not need to sound like your traditional “repeating loop” song. I hit the drum pads like a drum and I took that approach into arranging the entire beat. It gave me a new sense of inspiration. I didn’t want to disrupt the integrity of her demo because it was a beautiful song. I didn’t feel like there was a need to over produce. Most producers wanna show off but I feel a real producer should bring out the soul of the song and not plaster his/her own “signature” on it. That’s why this song worked. James did a huge favor by playing “less is more” on the guitars and Julia nailed her vocals in 45 mins that night in the studio. I even kept the backing vocals from her demo because they were priceless. Sometimes, the magic happens under the stars.
